CharName,PlainText
Benvolio,"Part, fools!
Put up your swords; you know not what you do."
Tybalt,"What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death."
Benvolio,"I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me."
Tybalt,"What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward!
[They fight]
[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;]
then enter Citizens, with clubs]"
Benvolio,"Here were the servants of your adversary,
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
I drew to part them: in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
Came more and more and fought on part and part,
Till the prince came, who parted either part."
Benvolio,"Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from the city's side,
So early walking did I see your son:
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
And stole into the covert of the wood:
I, measuring his affections by my own,
That most are busied when they're most alone,
Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me."
Benvolio,"My noble uncle, do you know the cause?"
Benvolio,"Have you importuned him by any means?"
Benvolio,"See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied."
Benvolio,"Good-morrow, cousin."
Romeo,"Is the day so young?"
Benvolio,"But new struck nine."
Romeo,"Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
Benvolio,"It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?"
Romeo,"Not having that, which, having, makes them short."
Benvolio,"In love?"
Romeo,Out--
Benvolio,"Of love?"
Romeo,"Out of her favour, where I am in love."
Benvolio,"Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!"
Romeo,"Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?"
Benvolio,"No, coz, I rather weep."
Romeo,"Good heart, at what?"
Benvolio,"At thy good heart's oppression."
Romeo,"Why, such is love's transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
What is it else? a madness most discreet,
A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz."
Benvolio,"Soft! I will go along;
An if you leave me so, you do me wrong."
Romeo,"Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
This is not Romeo, he's some other where."
Benvolio,"Tell me in sadness, who is that you love."
Romeo,"What, shall I groan and tell thee?"
Benvolio,"Groan! why, no.
But sadly tell me who."
Romeo,"Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman."
Benvolio,"I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved."
Romeo,"A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love."
Benvolio,"A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit."
Romeo,"Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
That when she dies with beauty dies her store."
Benvolio,"Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?"
Romeo,"She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
For beauty starved with her severity
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair:
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead that live to tell it now."
Benvolio,"Be ruled by me, forget to think of her."
Romeo,"O, teach me how I should forget to think."
Benvolio,"By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties."
Romeo,"'Tis the way
To call hers exquisite, in question more:
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget."
Benvolio,"I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt."
Benvolio,"Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die."
Romeo,"Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that."
Benvolio,"For what, I pray thee?"
Romeo,"For your broken shin."
Benvolio,"Why, Romeo, art thou mad?"
Romeo,"Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow."
Romeo,"Ay, mine own fortune in my misery."
Romeo,"Ay, if I know the letters and the language."
Romeo,"Stay, fellow; I can read.
[Reads]
'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
assembly: whither should they come?"
Romeo,Whither?
Romeo,"Whose house?"
Romeo,"Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before."
Benvolio,"At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
With all the admired beauties of Verona:
Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow."
Romeo,"When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
And these, who often drown'd could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun."
Benvolio,"Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself poised with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
Your lady's love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best."
Romeo,"I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendor of mine own."
Juliet,"How now! who calls?"
Juliet,"Madam, I am here.
What is your will?"
Juliet,"And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I."
Juliet,"It is an honour that I dream not of."
Juliet,"I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly."
Romeo,"What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without a apology?"
Benvolio,"The date is out of such prolixity:
We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will;
We'll measure them a measure, and be gone."
Romeo,"Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy, I will bear the light."
Romeo,"Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move."
Romeo,"I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
Under love's heavy burden do I sink."
Romeo,"Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn."
Benvolio,"Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
But every man betake him to his legs."
Romeo,"A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done."
Romeo,"Nay, that's not so."
Romeo,"And we mean well in going to this mask;
But 'tis no wit to go."
Romeo,"I dream'd a dream to-night."
Romeo,"Well, what was yours?"
Romeo,"In bed asleep, while they do dream things true."
Romeo,"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
Thou talk'st of nothing."
Benvolio,"This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
Supper is done, and we shall come too late."
Romeo,"I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night's revels and expire the term
Of a despised life closed in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen."
Benvolio,"Strike, drum."
Romeo,"[To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?"
Romeo,"O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night."
Tybalt,"This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin."
Tybalt,"Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night."
Tybalt,"'Tis he, that villain Romeo."
Tybalt,"It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
I'll not endure him."
Tybalt,"Why, uncle, 'tis a shame."
Tybalt,"Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall."
Romeo,"[To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss."
Juliet,"Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss."
Romeo,"Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
Juliet,"Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
Romeo,"O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair."
Juliet,"Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake."
Romeo,"Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged."
Juliet,"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
Romeo,"Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
Give me my sin again."
Juliet,"You kiss by the book."
Romeo,"What is her mother?"
Romeo,"Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! my life is my foe's debt."
Benvolio,"Away, begone; the sport is at the best."
Romeo,"Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest."
Juliet,"Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?"
Juliet,"What's he that now is going out of door?"
Juliet,"What's he that follows there, that would not dance?"
Juliet,"Go ask his name: if he be married.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed."
Juliet,"My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy."
Juliet,"A rhyme I learn'd even now
Of one I danced withal."
Romeo,"Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out."
Benvolio,"Romeo! my cousin Romeo!"
Benvolio,"He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio."
Benvolio,"And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him."
Benvolio,"Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
To be consorted with the humorous night:
Blind is his love and best befits the dark."
Benvolio,"Go, then; for 'tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found."
Romeo,"He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
[JULIET appears above at a window]
But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
Be not her maid, since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!"
Juliet,"Ay me!"
Romeo,"She speaks:
O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air."
Juliet,"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I'll no longer be a Capulet."
Romeo,"[Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?"
Juliet,"'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
What's in a name? that which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for that name which is no part of thee
Take all myself."
Romeo,"I take thee at thy word:
Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo."
Juliet,"What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
So stumblest on my counsel?"
Romeo,"By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee;
Had I it written, I would tear the word."
Juliet,"My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?"
Romeo,"Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike."
Juliet,"How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here."
Romeo,"With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me."
Juliet,"If they do see thee, they will murder thee."
Romeo,"Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity."
Juliet,"I would not for the world they saw thee here."
Romeo,"I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
And but thou love me, let them find me here:
My life were better ended by their hate,
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love."
Juliet,"By whose direction found'st thou out this place?"
Romeo,"By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise."
Juliet,"Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered."
Romeo,"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--"
Juliet,"O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable."
Romeo,"What shall I swear by?"
Juliet,"Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee."
Romeo,"If my heart's dear love--"
Juliet,"Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract to-night:
It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast!"
Romeo,"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
Juliet,"What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?"
Romeo,"The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine."
Juliet,"I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again."
Romeo,"Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?"
Juliet,"But to be frank, and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
[Nurse calls within]
I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again."
Romeo,"O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering-sweet to be substantial."
Juliet,"Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world."
Juliet,"I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
I do beseech thee--"
Juliet,"By and by, I come:--
To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
To-morrow will I send."
Romeo,"So thrive my soul--"
Juliet,"A thousand times good night!"
Romeo,"A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
their books,
But love from love, toward school with heavy looks."
Juliet,"Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
With repetition of my Romeo's name."
Romeo,"It is my soul that calls upon my name:
How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears!"
Juliet,Romeo!
Romeo,"My dear?"
Juliet,"At what o'clock to-morrow
Shall I send to thee?"
Romeo,"At the hour of nine."
Juliet,"I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back."
Romeo,"Let me stand here till thou remember it."
Juliet,"I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company."
Romeo,"And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this."
Juliet,"'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty."
Romeo,"I would I were thy bird."
Juliet,"Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night! parting is such
sweet sorrow,
That I shall say good night till it be morrow."
Romeo,"Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell."
Romeo,"Good morrow, father."
Romeo,"That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine."
Romeo,"With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
I have forgot that name, and that name's woe."
Romeo,"I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
That's by me wounded: both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies:
I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe."
Romeo,"Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combined, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage: when and where and how
We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us to-day."
Romeo,"Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline."
Romeo,"And bad'st me bury love."
Romeo,"I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
The other did not so."
Romeo,"O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste."
Benvolio,"Not to his father's; I spoke with his man."
Benvolio,"Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
Hath sent a letter to his father's house."
Benvolio,"Romeo will answer it."
Benvolio,"Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
dares, being dared."
Benvolio,"Why, what is Tybalt?"
Benvolio,"The what?"
Benvolio,"Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo."
Romeo,"Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?"
Romeo,"Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy."
Romeo,"Meaning, to court'sy."
Romeo,"A most courteous exposition."
Romeo,"Pink for flower."
Romeo,"Why, then is my pump well flowered."
Romeo,"O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
singleness."
Romeo,"Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match."
Romeo,"Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
not there for the goose."
Romeo,"Nay, good goose, bite not."
Romeo,"And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?"
Romeo,"I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose."
Benvolio,"Stop there, stop there."
Benvolio,"Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large."
Romeo,"Here's goodly gear!"
Benvolio,"Two, two; a shirt and a smock."
Romeo,"One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
mar."
Romeo,"I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
you have found him than he was when you sought him:
I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse."
Benvolio,"She will indite him to some supper."
Romeo,"What hast thou found?"
Romeo,"I will follow you."
Romeo,"A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
to in a month."
Romeo,"Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
protest unto thee--"
Romeo,"What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me."
Romeo,"Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains."
Romeo,"Go to; I say you shall."
Romeo,"And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
Within this hour my man shall be with thee
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress."
Romeo,"What say'st thou, my dear nurse?"
Romeo,"I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel."
Romeo,"Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R."
Romeo,"Commend me to thy lady."
Juliet,"The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
Driving back shadows over louring hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me:
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
O God, she comes!
[Enter Nurse and PETER]
O honey nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away."
Juliet,"Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face."
Juliet,"I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak."
Juliet,"How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?"
Juliet,"No, no: but all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? what of that?"
Juliet,"I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?"
Juliet,"Where is my mother! why, she is within;
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Where is your mother?'"
Juliet,"Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?"
Juliet,"I have."
Juliet,"Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell."
Romeo,"Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight:
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
It is enough I may but call her mine."
Juliet,"Good even to my ghostly confessor."
Juliet,"As much to him, else is his thanks too much."
Romeo,"Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
Unfold the imagined happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter."
Juliet,"Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth."
Benvolio,"I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring."
Benvolio,"Am I like such a fellow?"
Benvolio,"And what to?"
Benvolio,"An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter."
Benvolio,"By my head, here come the Capulets."
Tybalt,"Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you."
Tybalt,"You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
will give me occasion."
Tybalt,"Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--"
Benvolio,"We talk here in the public haunt of men:
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us."
Tybalt,"Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man."
Tybalt,"Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
No better term than this,--thou art a villain."
Romeo,"Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting: villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not."
Tybalt,"Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw."
Romeo,"I do protest, I never injured thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise,
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
As dearly as my own,--be satisfied."
Tybalt,"What wouldst thou have with me?"
Tybalt,"I am for you."
Romeo,"Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up."
Romeo,"Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!"
Benvolio,"What, art thou hurt?"
Romeo,"Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much."
Romeo,"I thought all for the best."
Romeo,"This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!"
Benvolio,"O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth."
Romeo,"This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
This but begins the woe, others must end."
Benvolio,"Here comes the furious Tybalt back again."
Romeo,"Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
Away to heaven, respective lenity,
And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
[Re-enter TYBALT]
Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company:
Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him."
Tybalt,"Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence."
Romeo,"This shall determine that."
Benvolio,"Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!"
Romeo,"O, I am fortune's fool!"
Benvolio,"Why dost thou stay?"
Benvolio,"There lies that Tybalt."
Benvolio,"O noble prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio."
Benvolio,"Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
Your high displeasure: all this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die."
Juliet,"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
[Enter Nurse, with cords]
Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
That Romeo bid thee fetch?"
Juliet,"Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?"
Juliet,"Can heaven be so envious?"
Juliet,"What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
I am not I, if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe."
Juliet,"O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!"
Juliet,"What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
For who is living, if those two are gone?"
Juliet,"O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?"
Juliet,"O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace!"
Juliet,"Blister'd be thy tongue
For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!"
Juliet,"Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
But, O, it presses to my memory,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
Which modern lamentations might have moved?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?"
Juliet,"Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
He made you for a highway to my bed;
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!"
Juliet,"O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell."
Romeo,"Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?"
Romeo,"What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?"
Romeo,"Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'"
Romeo,"There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
And world's exile is death: then banished,
Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me."
Romeo,"'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not: more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
But Romeo may not; he is banished:
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
To mangle me with that word 'banished'?"
Romeo,"O, thou wilt speak again of banishment."
Romeo,"Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more."
Romeo,"How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?"
Romeo,"Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave."
Romeo,"Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes."
Romeo,Nurse!
Romeo,"Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
Doth she not think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
With blood removed but little from her own?
Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?"
Romeo,"As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion."
Romeo,"Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide."
Romeo,"How well my comfort is revived by this!"
Romeo,"But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell."
Juliet,"Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Romeo,"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Juliet,"Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone."
Romeo,"Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
I have more care to stay than will to go:
Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day."
Juliet,"It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us:
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
O, now I would they had changed voices too!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
O, now be gone; more light and light it grows."
Romeo,"More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!"
Juliet,Nurse?
Juliet,"Then, window, let day in, and let life out."
Romeo,"Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend."
Juliet,"Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days:
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo!"
Romeo,"Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee."
Juliet,"O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?"
Romeo,"I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come."
Juliet,"O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale."
Romeo,"And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!"
Juliet,"O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
But send him back."
Juliet,"Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?"
Juliet,"Madam, I am not well."
Juliet,"Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss."
Juliet,"Feeling so the loss,
Cannot choose but ever weep the friend."
Juliet,"What villain madam?"
Juliet,"[Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart."
Juliet,"Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!"
Juliet,"Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it;
That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that slaughter'd him!"
Juliet,"And joy comes well in such a needy time:
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?"
Juliet,"Madam, in happy time, what day is that?"
Juliet,"Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!"
Juliet,"Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate, that is meant love."
Juliet,"Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word."
Juliet,"Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies."
Juliet,"O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself!
What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, nurse."
Juliet,"Speakest thou from thy heart?"
Juliet,Amen!
Juliet,"Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
To make confession and to be absolved."
Juliet,"Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath praised him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
If all else fail, myself have power to die."
Juliet,"That may be, sir, when I may be a wife."
Juliet,"What must be shall be."
Juliet,"To answer that, I should confess to you."
Juliet,"I will confess to you that I love him."
Juliet,"If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face."
Juliet,"The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite."
Juliet,"That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
And what I spake, I spake it to my face."
Juliet,"It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?"
Juliet,"O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!"
Juliet,"Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy."
Juliet,"O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love."
Juliet,"Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!"
Juliet,"Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father!"
Juliet,"Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you."
Juliet,"I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty."
Juliet,"Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?"
Juliet,"Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin."
Juliet,"No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
In this so sudden business."
Juliet,"Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
Nurse! What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
[Laying down her dagger]
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee."
Romeo,"If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
to think!--
And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
That I revived, and was an emperor.
Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
For nothing can be ill, if she be well."
Romeo,"Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night."
Romeo,"Tush, thou art deceived:
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?"
Romeo,"No matter: get thee gone,
And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
[Exit BALTHASAR]
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
I do remember an apothecary,--
And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said
'An if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
What, ho! apothecary!"
Romeo,"Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins
That the life-weary taker may fall dead
And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
As violently as hasty powder fired
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb."
Romeo,"Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it, and take this."
Romeo,"I pay thy poverty, and not thy will."
Romeo,"There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee."
Romeo,"Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death,
Is partly to behold my lady's face;
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
The time and my intents are savage-wild,
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea."
Romeo,"So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow."
Romeo,"Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!"
Romeo,"I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head,
By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm'd against myself:
Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
A madman's mercy bade thee run away."
Romeo,"Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!"
Romeo,"In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
[Laying PARIS in the tomb]
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! which their keepers call
A lightning before death: O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous,
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again: here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest,
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
Here's to my love!
[Drinks]
O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
[Dies]
[Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR]
LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]"
Juliet,"O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?"
Juliet,"Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.
[Kisses him]
Thy lips are warm."
Juliet,"Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
This is thy sheath;
[Stabs herself]
there rust, and let me die."
